Part 2: Backend Development (PHP or Node.js with MySQL) - 10 Experiments [Option B: Node.js & MySQL Experiments]

Objective: To understand server-side programming, database interaction, and building dynamic web applications. Students choose either PHP or Node.js for their backend.

Common Requirements for Backend Experiments:

● Database: Use MySQL for all database-related experiments.

● Error Handling: Implement basic error handling for database connections and queries.

● Security (Basic): Be mindful of SQL injection (use prepared statements if available in your chosen language).

● Structure: Organize your backend code logically (e.g., separate database connection, routes, and logic).
