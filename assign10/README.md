# Option B: Node.js & MySQL Experiments

# Experiment 10: RESTful API for Data

● Task: Create a set of RESTful API endpoints using Node.js (e.g., with Express.js) to perform CRUD operations on one of your database tables (e.g., posts).

● Requirements:

1. Implement routes for GET /api/posts (get all), GET /api/posts/:id (get one), POST /api/posts (create), PUT /api/posts/:id (update), DELETE /api/posts/:id (delete).
2. Return JSON responses for all operations.
3. Use prepared statements for all database interactions.
